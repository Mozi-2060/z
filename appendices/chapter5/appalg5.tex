      Construct a region in $S$ for every OST pulled back to by a region of $G$\;
      Connect regions of $S$ according to instructions from the edges of $G$\;
      Fill holes of $S$ according to instructions from the edges of $G$\;
      Mark external boundary as false\;
      Compute gleams $\glm$ of regions of $S$\;
      Return $(S,\glm)$\;
