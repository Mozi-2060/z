This algorithm finds all chordless cycles in a planar graph $G$.
The algorithm is common.
Delete all vertices of degree at most one.
Repeat this until there are no vertices of degree at most one.
Begin at an arbitrary vertex $v$ and compute all chordless cycles passing through that vertex.
This is easily done by a breadth first search away from $v$.
In a planar graph, the number of chordless cycles passing through $v$ is bounded above by the degree of $v$.
Delete $v$.
Repeat this algorithm until the graph is empty.
