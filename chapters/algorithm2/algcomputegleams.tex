%Fortunately, by Lemma 4.4 of Thurston and Costantino, every region of our shadow $S$ is a disk.
%Continuing to use the Stein factorization of $\pi=g\comp h$, this means that the interior $R'$ region $R$ in $S$ has preimage through $g$ of an open solid torus, which we consider as a circle bundle over a disc.
