%A line $L$ in the plane that contains none of $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$ separates the plane into two connected components and partitions $\{p,q,r,s\}$ into two sets.
%If a partition contains:
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item the empty set, then the preimage of $L\cap\pi(T)$ pulls back to the empty set.
%  \item a set with one element, then the preimage of $L\cap\pi(T)$ pulls back to a normal triangle in $T$.
%  \item a set with two elements, then the preimage of $L\cap\pi(T)$ pulls back to a normal quadrilateral in $T$.
%\end{enumerate}
