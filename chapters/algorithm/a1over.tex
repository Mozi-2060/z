We focus on obtaining the piecewise linear analogue to the generic proper smooth map of Section \ref{sec:3bound4}.
The properties this map must satisfy are laid out in Section \ref{sub:genericplmap}, and the algorithms used to ensure these conditions are laid out in the intermediate sections.

From $T$ a closed, orientable, edge--distinct 3--manifold triangulation, we obtain:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A solid polyhedral gluing $T'$ that is homeomorphic to $T$ minus some 3--balls.
	\item A piecewise--linear map $\pi':T'\to\C$ analogous to a generic proper smooth map.
	\item A 2--complex $T'^*$ dual to $T'$.
	\item A 2--complex $X'$ generated by $\pi'$.
\end{enumerate}
These are the data carried forward to Section \ref{sec:stein} that store the information used to construct a Stein complex for $\pi'$.
