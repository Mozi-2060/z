The first construction in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:3stein4} is a 3--handlebody regular neighbourhood of the 1--skeleton of our Stein complex $S$.
Put $G$ to be the 1--skeleton of $S$ and $A\subset G$ a maximal spanning tree.
We know that $G$ is a graph where, for any vertex $v$ of $G$, $\deg_G v$ is 3 if $v$ is boundary and 4 if it is interior.

We first triangulate the building blocks of Figure \ref{fig:3thickeningblocks} and display them in Figure \ref{fig:3thicktri}.
Each block in Figure \ref{fig:3thicktri} depicts one view of a triangulated 2--sphere.
The blocks have symmetry that should be clear, and the full triangulated block is found by taking the cone on the triangulated 2--sphere depicted.
Note that each edge block is actually a triangulated prism, and the only difference between the blocks is the set of marked boundary curves.
The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:3stein4} is procedural in its creation of handlebodies, and the details for the triangulated case are contained in Algorithm \ref{alg:4handlebody}.
In this section we use the notation laid out in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:3stein4}, and we take $A\subset G$ to be fixed throughout.

The result of Algorithm \ref{alg:4handlebody} includes strips inside of solid tori $V$ used to compute 0--framing curves.
When the strip is an annulus, the curve is found as one of the boundary components of the annulus.
When it is a M\"obius strip, there is one boundary component $2\lambda$.
We take $2\Lambda$ halfway around its length to one full longitude of $V$, and perform one last positive half twist in order to get an actual 0--framing curve $\lambda$.
To be precise, the half twist is a curve $\gamma$ in the meridian direction of the boundary of $V$ connecting the endpoints of $\frac{1}{2}(2\lambda)$, and the positive direction is the anticlockwise direction determined by the $\II^2$ fibers over the boundary component of $U_S(G)$.
