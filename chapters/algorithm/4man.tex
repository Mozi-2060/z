We leave Section \ref{sec:stein} with an integer decorated 2--complex that is taken to be the Stein complex for a map constructed in Section \ref{sec:proj} analogous to the generic proper smooth map of Section \ref{sec:3bound4}.
This complex is a set of instructions for building a cobordism of the pair $(M,\emptyset)$, shown in Section \ref{sec:3bound4}.
The steps to that construction were:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Perform a 3--thickening of the 1--skeleton of the Stein complex.
	\item Locate a set of curves on the boundary that correspond to 
	\item
	
\end{enumerate}
