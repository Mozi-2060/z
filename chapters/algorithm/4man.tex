We leave Section \ref{sec:stein} with an integer decorated 2--complex that is taken to be the Stein complex for a map constructed in Section \ref{sec:proj} analogous to the generic proper smooth map of Section \ref{sec:3bound4}.
This complex is a set of instructions for building a cobordism of the pair $(M,\emptyset)$, shown in Section \ref{sec:3bound4}.
First, build a 3--thickening of a regular neighbourhood of a maximal spanning tree of the 1--skeleton of the Stein complex.
Second, perform a 4--thickening.
Third, complete the thickening into a 4--handlebody.
Finally, attach the appropriate 2--handles.
Before embarking on this construction, we define some standard building blocks that we can use to keep track of essential information in the defining of a 0--framing for 2--handle attachment.
