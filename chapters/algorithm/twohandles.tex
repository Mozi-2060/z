We now concern ourselves with 2--handle attachment, and the necessary data has already been computed.
Every 2--cell of $S$ is equipped with an integer framing coefficient, a triangulated solid torus that serves as an attaching region, and a curve in the boundary torus that represent a 0--framing.

Let $c$ be the 2--cell, $V$ the solid torus with boundary $\pd V = v$, $\lambda$ the curve representing the 0--framing, and $n_c$ the framing coefficient.
The general idea is that we build a triangulated 3--sphere $Z$ containing $V$ as a subtriangulation such that a curve $\lambda^n$ at $n_c$ meridinal twists away from $\lambda\subset v$ bounds a disc in $Z\setminus V$.
We assume that $V$ has been subdivided enough to admit a curve satisfying the conditions of $\lambda^n$. 
With $Z$ built, the cone $CZ$ is a 4--disc with the desired 2--handle structure to attach over $V$.
