Data types used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A cell complex $T_2$, modified by the actions in Sections \ref{alg:truncttet} and \ref{alg:blowup};
	\item A cell complex ${}^\ast\!T_2$, obtained as the dual complex to $T_0$ and modified by the actions in Sections \ref{alg:truncttet} and \ref{alg:blowup};
	\item A simple polyhedron $S$ that is a Stein complex for $T_2$;
	\item The regions of $D_i$ of $S$ which are homeomorphic to open 2--discs per Lemma 4.4 of \cite{CostThur08} and were built in Section \ref{alg:constreg} from a set of subregions $\{B_{i,k}\}$;
	\item The edges $e_i$ of $S$, of which some are the false boundary edges coloured $F$ in Section \ref{alg:constreg}.
\end{itemize}

Before delving into the details of framing constant computation, we will briefly discuss the theory of the method outlined in Section 4.6 of \cite{CostThur08}.
Because $S$ is a Stein complex for $T_2$, we can describe $\pi_2$ as a Stein factorization $\pi_2=f\comp g$, where $f$ is a map $T_2\to S$ and $g$ is a map $S\to \RR$.
Let $\overline{D}$ denote the abstract compactification of $D$ in $S$, i.e.\ $\overline{D}$ is a 2--complex whose 2--cell is $D$ and whose 1-- and 0--cells are the edges and vertices of $S$ that are incident to $D$.
Suppose that $D$ has not been assigned a framing constant and $\overline{D}$ has no false edges.
The preimage of $\overline{D}$ through $f$ is a closed solid torus in $T_2$.
Recall from Corollary \ref{cor:3stein4} that 
As demonstrated in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:3bound4}, the framing constant that will be used to attach a 4--dimensional 2--handle
