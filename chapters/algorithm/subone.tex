With the 0--cells of $S$ determined, we find the 1--cells.
As with the vertices, the 1--cells of the Stein complex project over the 1--cells of $X'$.
Take $p$, $q$ vertices of $S$ adjacent over an edge $e$ of $X'$.
To find the associated edges of $S$, examine the sets of interactive elements over $p$ and $q$.
The shared circles within the elements of $N(p)$ and $N(q)$ tell us whether a pair of vertices are adjacent in $S$.
