This final chapter develops and details a composite of algorithms that takes as input an oriented edge--distinct triangulation $T$ of a 3--manifold $M$, and produces a triangulation of a 4--manifold $W$ whose boundary is $M$.
Section \ref{sec:3bound4} outlines the general flow we follow.

We begin with a triangulation $T$ of a 3--manifold $M$.
First we find suitable map from $T$ to the 2--disc.
This map yields a Stein complex.
The Stein complex provides instructions for building a triangulation for 4--manifold $W$ whose boundary is $M$.
