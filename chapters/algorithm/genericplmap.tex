This section comes to fruition with the definition of the piecewise--linear analog to a generic proper smooth map.
Let $T$ be a closed, orientable, edge--distinct 3--manifold triangulation.
We build a map $\pi':T'\to\C$ satisfying the following criteria.

First, the space $T'$ is a solid polyhedral gluing whose boundary components are homeomorphic to $S^2$.
Second, attaching 3--balls over the boundary components of $T'$ results in a complex homeomorphic to $T$.
Third, for any pair of edges $E$, $F$ in $T'$, if $\pi'(E)\cap\pi(F)=z$ is nonempty, then $z$ is not the intersection of any other pair of edges in $T'$.
Fourth, the wedge number of every edge of $T'$ is 0, 1, or 2.

The first two conditions are met by modifying $T$ only through truncation and the blowing up of edges.
Condition three we obtain by requiring $\pi$ to be crossing distinct on $T$, and then modifying $T$ only in the controlled ways discussed in this section.
For condition four, we blow up the appropriate edges.
The details are laid out in Algorithm \ref{alg:proj}, where we also obtain the 2--complex associated to $\pi'$ along the way.
We pass the results of Algorithm \ref{alg:proj} into the algorithms of Section \ref{sec:stein}
