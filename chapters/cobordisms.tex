\label{cha:cobordisms}

We now delve into some arguments for smooth manifolds.
Once the general idea is in place, the following chapters make explicit the corresponding construction for triangulations of manifolds.

The This let's us define a central theme to the topics discussed in this thesis.

\begin{defn}
  Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be $n$--manifolds.
  If there exists an $(n+1)$--manifold with boundary $M_1\cup M_2$, we say that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are \emph{cobordant}.
\end{defn}
