Survey of results: 3--manifolds bounding 4--manifolds.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Result using characteristic classes~\cite{MilnStas}.
	\item Result by embedding in $\R^5$~\cite{Hirsch61}~\cite{Rokhlin65}~\cite{Wall65}
	\item Result using Heegard decompositions~\cite{Rourke85}
\end{enumerate}

Historical arguments prove 3--manifolds bound 4--manifolds, but we normally describe our 3-- and 4--manifolds using triangulations.
We would like a process that takes us from a triangulated 3--manifold to a triangulated 4--manifold.
The work done by Turaev in ~\cite{Turaev91} paved the way for an argument in ~\cite{CostThur08} that includes a process, initially used to estimate a bound on the number of 4--dimensional simplices needed to triangulate a 4--manifold whose boundary is an input 3--manifold, which is made algorithmic in this thesis.
