\begin{defn}[Coordinates]
	\label{def:coordinates}
	Let $X$ be a topological space.
	Let $U$ be an open subset of $X$ and let $V$ and open subset of the real half-space
	$$\RNP=\{(x_1,\dots,x_{n})\in\RRN : x_n\geq 0\}.$$
	A homeomorphism $f:U\to V$ is called a \emph{coordinate system} on $U$.
	Writing $f$ as $f(u)=(\xi_1(u),\dots,\xi_n(u))$, the functions $\xi_i$ are \emph{coordinate functions}.
	The pair $(U,f)$ is a \emph{chart} of $X$, and the inverse map $f\inv$ is called a \emph{parameterization} of $U$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Atlas]
	\label{def:atlas}
	Let $\mathcal{A}=\{(U_\alpha,f_\alpha)\}$ be a collection of charts of the topological space $X$ parameterized by $\alpha\in A$.
	If $\bigcup_A U_\alpha$ contains $X$, then $\mathcal{A}$ is an \emph{atlas} for $X$.
	The homeomorphisms $f_\alpha\comp f_\beta\inv:f_\beta(U_\alpha\cap U_\beta)\to f_\alpha(U_\alpha\cap U_\beta)$ are \emph{transition maps} of $\mathcal{A}$.
	An atlas is said to be a \emph{smooth atlas} if all of its transition maps are smooth.
	Two smooth atlases are \emph{equivalent} if their union is a smooth atlas.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Manifolds]
	\label{def:manifold}
	Let $X$ be a separable Hausdorff topological space, and $\mathcal{A}$ an atlas for $X$.
	The charts of $\mathcal{A}$ are maps from open sets of $X$ to the open half space $\RNP$.
	If $\mathcal{A}$ is a smooth alas, then $X$ is a \emph{smooth n--manifold}, or just \emph{n--manifold}.
	A \emph{smooth structure} on $X$ is a maximal smooth atlas for $X$.
	If $X$ is an $n$--manifold and $Y\subset X$ satisfies the definition of an $m$--manifold, then $Y$ is an $m$--dimensional \emph{submanifold} of $X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Boundary, Interior]	
	\label{def:boundary}
	Let $X$ be a manifold.
	Let $p\in X$ and $(U,f)$ a chart with $p\in U$.
	If $f(p)$ is in the subset $\{(x_1,\dots,x_n): x_n = 0\}$ of $\RNP$, then $p$ is a \emph{boundary point} of $X$.
	The set of all boundary points of $X$, called the \emph{boundary of $X$}, is denoted by $\pd X$.
	A point $x$ in $X\setminus \pd X$ is called \emph{interior}.
	If $X$ is compact and $\pd X=\emptyset$, then $X$ is a \emph{closed manifold}.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}[Boundaries are Manifolds]
	\label{prop:boundariesaremanifolds}
	Let $X$ be an $n$--manifold.
	The boundary of $X$, $\pd X$, is an $(n-1)$--dimensional closed submanifold of $X$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\mathcal{A} = \{(U_\alpha, f_\alpha)\}$ be a smooth structure on $X$.
	We can construct a smooth atlas for $\pd X$ from $\mathcal{A}$
	
\end{proof}

Brief Digression On Orientations of $\RRN$.

\begin{defn}
	\label{def:orient}
	
	here we define tangent spaces and orientability of a manifold
	
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	\label{def:isotopy}
	
	A smooth \emph{isotopy} between embeddings $\varphi_0,\varphi_1:Y\to X$ is a smooth homotopy $\varphi_t: Y \to X$ ($0\leq t\leq 1$) through embeddings.
	If an isotopy exists, we say that $\varphi_0,\varphi_1$ are \emph{isotopic}.
	
\end{defn}

brief digression on isotopy extension

\begin{theorem}[Isotopy Extension \{CITE: Miln\}]
	\label{thm:isotopyextension}
	
	Let $M$ be a smooth compact submanifold of the smooth closed manifold $N$.
	If $h_t$ is a smooth isotopy of the inclusion $M\into N$ then $h_t$ is the restriction of a smooth isotopy $h_t':N\to N$ of the identity $\ident{N}$ such that $h_t'$ is the identity on $N$ outside of a compact subset of $N$.
	
\end{theorem}

We would like to restate the above theorem into a more useful form.
Let $Y\subset X$ be a smooth compact submanifold in the interior of the smooth manifold $X$ and let $i:Y\into X$ be inclusion.
Any smooth isotopy $\varphi_t:Y\to X$ with $\varphi_0=i$ induces an isotopy $\Phi_t:X\to X$ through diffeomorphisms $X\to X$ with $\Phi_0=\ident{X}$ and $\varphi_t=\Phi_t\comp\varphi_0$ for each $t$.
The isotopy $\Phi_t$ is called an \emph{ambient isotopy}, and a pair of submanifolds $Y_1,Y_2$ of $X$ are \emph{ambiently isotopic} is there exists a diffeomorphism $\Phi:X\to X$ such that $\Phi$ is homotopic to $\ident{X}$ through diffeomorphisms and $\Phi$ maps $Y_1$ to $Y_2$.
