The main tool used to construct 4--manifolds in later chapters is handle attachment.
We focus mainly on the definitions and results needed to meaningfully attach 1-- and 2--handles to a 4--manifold.
There is more than one way to define handle attachment, and we choose to do so in a way that feels more combinatorial in nature.
The main concern of this approach is that the object resulting from handle attachment is a ``manifold with corners'' rather than a smooth manifold.
There are arguments that the corners can be smoothed away in a canonical way such that a manifold obtained via handle attachment is unique up to diffeomorphism, but delving into such an argument at this point would be a distraction.
\{NOTE: perhaps include an argument as an appendix?\}
A construction that does not require the smoothing of corners can be found in \cite{Kosi93}, but the machinery makes explicit handle attachment unnecessarily complicated.


Attaching an $n$--dimensional $\lambda$--handle to $M$ is the process of joining $M$ to $\D^\lambda\times\D^\mu$ along an embedding of $\pd\D^\lambda\times\D^\mu$ in $\pd M$.


\begin{defn}[Handle]
	Put $n=\lambda+\mu$ and let $M$ be an $n$--manifold with boundary.
	
	
	Let $f:S^{\lambda-1}\to \pd M$ be an embedding with proper tubular neighbourhoods $\nu_{\pd M}\,f$ and $\nu_M\,f$ and $F:T\to M$ an extension of $f$ such that $\restr{F}{S^\lambda}$ is a vector bundle isomorphism to a proper tubular neighbourhood of $f(S^{\lambda-1})$ in $\pd M$, and $F(T)$ is a proper tubular neighbourhood in the sense of Definition \ref{def:halfneighbourhood} .
	We obtain a new space by identifying $x\in T\setminus h(S^{\lambda-1})$ with $F\comp\alpha(x)\in M\setminus f(S^{\lambda-1})$, a process we call \emph{attaching an $n$--dimensional $\lambda$--handle to $M$ along $f(S^{\lambda-1})$}.
	We denote the new space by $M\cup_f H^\lambda$.	
\end{defn}

Attaching a handle is a special case of joining a pair of manifolds along submanifolds of the boundary.
Theorem \ref{thm:joinman} applies, so attachment of a handle over $f$ is unique up to a bundle automorphism.
Our uniqueness theorem for proper tubular neighbourhoods applies as well, so attachment of a handle is unique up to ambient isotopy of the embedding $f$.
In other words, the characteristics of handle attachment that fully describe the smooth $n$--manifold $M\cup_f H^\lambda$ up to diffeomorphism are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The isotopy class of the embedding $f:S^{\lambda-1}\to\pd M$ where the proper tubular neighbourhood $\nu_{\pd M}\,f(S^{\lambda-1})$ has trivial structure as the normal bundle $N_{\pd M}\,f(S^{\lambda-1})$, and 
	\item the isotopy class of the extension of $f$ to $F: S^{\lambda-1}\times R^\mu\to \nu_{\pd M}\,f(S^{\lambda-1})$, an explicit trivialization of the normal bundle.
\end{enumerate}

There is some specific language that is useful to the description of handle attachment.

\begin{defn}
	Let $M\cup_h H^\lambda$ be an $n$--manifold with a $\lambda$--handle attached.
	The embedding $f:S^{\lambda-1}\to\pd M$ is called the \emph{attaching map}, its image $f(S^{\lambda-1})$ is the \emph{attaching sphere}, and its tubular neighbourhood is the \emph{attaching neighbourhood}.
	The explicit trivialization $F: S^{\lambda-1}\times \R^\mu\to \nu_{\pd M}\,h(S^{\lambda-1})$ is called a \emph{normal framing} or just \emph{framing}.
	Identify $M\setminus f(S^{\lambda})$ and $\DN\setminus S^{\lambda-1}$ with their images in $M\cup_f H^\lambda$.
	Then $\DN\setminus S^{\lambda-1}$ is the \emph{handle}, the disc $\D^\lambda=\DN\cap(\R^\lambda\times\{\vec{0}\})$ is the \emph{core} of the handle, and the disc $\D^\mu=\DN\cap(\{\vec{0}\}\times\R^\mu)$ is the \emph{cocore} of the handle.
	The boundary $S^{\mu-1}$ of the cocore is the \emph{belt sphere}.
\end{defn}

There are two special cases of handle attachment to discuss.
First, let $M$ be a smooth, orientable, path--connected $n$--manifold.
The attaching sphere of a 1--handle is $S^0=\pd \D^1$, which is a pair of points.
For $\pd M$ compact, connected, and nonempty, there is a unique isotopy class of embeddings $f:S^0\to\pd M$.
This means that $M\cup_f H^1$ is determined entirely by the extension of $f$.
The normal bundle is a $(n-1)$--vector bundle over $S^0$, so it is vacuously trivial.
A trivialization of $\R^{n-1}\times S^0$ can be written as a pair of elements $A_{-1}$, $A_1$ from $\gl{n-1}{\R}$, each acting on one of the connected components of $\R^{n-1}\times S^0$.
The group $\gl{n-1}{\R}$ has two path--connected components, denoted $\gln{n-1}{\R}$ and $\glp{n-1}{\R}$, which are the spaces of negative and positive determinant transformations respectively.
Every element of $\gl{n-1}{\R}$ is an embedding $\R^{n-1}\to\R^{n-1}$, so any path in $\gl{n-1}{\R}$ is an isotopy of its endpoints.
It is then easy to see that are four isotopy classes of our trivialization, and those fall into two types.
Either both $A_{-1}$ and $A_1$ are are orientation preserving (reversing), or $A_{-1}$ is orientation preserving (reversing) and $A_1$ is orientation reversing (preserving).
Under the first type of automorphism, $M\cup_f H^1$ is a non-orientable manifold.
Under the second, $M\cup_f H^1$ is orientable.

Next, let $W$ be a 4--manifold with orientable boundary $M$.
To attach a 2--handle to $W$, we need an embedding $f:S^1\to M$ and a framing of the normal bundle $N_M f(S^1)$.
The normal bundle is homeomorphic to $S^1\times D^2$, so it is what we call a solid torus.

\begin{defn}
	A space $V$ that is homeomorphic to $S^1\times\DD$ is called a \emph{solid torus}.	
	A simple closed curve $J$ in $\pd V$ that bounds a 2--disc in $V$ is called a \emph{meridian}.
	A simple closed curve $K$ in $\pd V$ that intersects a meridian at a single point is called a \emph{longitude}.
	Note that there are infinitely many isotopy classes of longitudes of $V$, whereas there's exactly one isotopy class of meridians.
\end{defn}

Once an embedding $f:S^1\to M$ is chosen, $W\cup_f H^2$ is determined by the framing $F:S^1\times \R^2\to \nu_{\pd M}\,f(S^1)$.
To investigate possible framings, we consider the \emph{mapping class group} of the solid torus.
The mapping class group of a space $X$ is the group of isotopy classes of automorphisms $X$, and it is denoted $mpg(X)$.
For $V$ a solid torus, $mpg(V)$ is very closely linked to the mapping class group of the torus $T^2 = S^1\times S^1=\pd V$, which is the special linear group $\textrm{SL}_2(\Z)$, the group of $2\times 2$ matrices with integer entries and determinant $\pm 1$.
\begin{lem}
	Let $V$ be an open solid torus and let $f$ be an automorphism of the torus $\pd V$.
	Then $h$ extends to an automorphism of $V$ if and only if $f$ maps a meridian to a meridian.	
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
	A pair of automorphisms $f,g$ of $V$ that agree on $\pd V$ and map a meridian to a meridian are isotopic.	
\end{lem}

\begin{theorem}
	The mapping class group of a solid torus $V$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group of $\pd V$ containing automorphisms that map meridians to meridians.
	This subgroup is isomorphic to $\Z$.	
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	In \cite{Rolf76}, it is shown that the mapping class group of $T^2$ is $\textrm{SL}_2(\Z)$ by generating the group from a pair of basic automorphisms of $T^2$ called \emph{twists}, and the swapping map $(z,w)\to(w,z)$.
	The twists are defined as:
	\[
	\begin{array}{ccccc}
	h_L(e^{i\theta},e^{i\phi}) & = & (e^{i(\theta+\phi)},e^{i\phi}) & & \textrm{``longitudinal twist''} \\
	
	h_M(e^{i\theta},e^{i\phi}) & = & (e^{i\theta},e^{i(\theta+\phi)}) & & \textrm{``meridinal twist''}	
	\end{array}
	\]
	Fix the meridinal and longitudinal directions of the boundary of an open solid torus $V$ to coincide with the meridinal and longitudinal directions of $V$.
	This would mean that we write $V=S^1\times D^2$, with $\{1\}\times S^1$ a meridian and $S^1\times\{1\}$ a longitude.
	Notice that the meridinal twist maps a meridian to a meridian, so it extends to an automorphism of $V$.
	Also, neither the longitudinal twist nor the swap map a meridian to a meridian, so neither extend to an automorphism of $V$.
	
	Let $F$ be an automorphism of $V$ with restriction $f$ to $\pd V$.
	Because $f$ is an automorphism of $\pd V$, it can be written as the product of twists and swaps.
	Because $f$ preserves meridians, it can be written entirely as a power of the meridinal twist.
	In the other direction, any automorphism that is the power of a meridinal twist clearly preserves meridians.
	Because these automorphisms are written as powers of $h_M$, there is a clear isomorphism from this subgroup to $\Z$.
\end{proof}

The content of these results means that the attachment of a 2--handle to a 4--manifold can be described by an embedding $f:S^1\to M$ and an integer $k$ called the \emph{framing constant} that determines the framing automorphism as long as we know what a framing constant of $0$ means.
To see this, first notice that $h_M$ can be extended to
\[
	\begin{array}{cccc}
		H_M: & S^1\times\DD & \to & S^1\times\DD \\
			& (e^{i\theta}, re^{i\phi}) & \mapsto & (e^{i\theta},re^{i(\theta+\phi)})	
	\end{array}
\]
which represents a generator of $mpg(S^1\times\DD)$.


 restricts to , and can be pre-- and post--composed by the homeomorphism
\[
	\begin{array}{cccl}
		\varphi: & S^1\times D^2 & \to & S^1\times \R^2 \\
				 & (e^{i\theta}, re^{i\phi}) & \mapsto & (e^{i\theta}, -\ln(1-r)e^{i\phi})
	\end{array}	
\]
and its inverse to obtain a homeomorphism $S^1\times \R^2\to S^1\times \R^2$ that represents a generator of $mpg(S^1\times\R^2)$.
Because $\nu_{\pd M}\,f(S^1)$ is homeomorphic to $S^1\times\R^2$, a one-to-one correspondence
$\psi$ between $mpg(S^1\times\R^2)$ and the isotopy classes of maps $S^1\times\R^2\to\nu_{\pd M}\,f(S^1)$ is determined entirely by $\psi(\id)$.

When $M$ is $S^3$, $f:S^1\to S^3$ is a \emph{knot}, and $\nu_M\,f(S^1)$ is an open solid torus.
There is choice of longitude for
