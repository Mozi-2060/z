The main tool used to construct 4--manifolds in later chapters is handle attachment.
We focus mainly on the definitions and results needed to meaningfully attach 2--handles to a 4--manifold, using the methods that are explored in detail in \cite{Kosi93} to attach handles in way that ensures the resulting manifold is smooth.

Let $n=\lambda+\mu$.
We write elements of $\RRN=\R^\lambda\times\R^\mu$ as $x=(x_\lambda,x_\mu)$, where $x_\lambda$ is the result of projecting $x$ onto the first $\lambda$ coordinates of $\RRN$ and $x_\mu$ is the result of projection onto the last $\mu$ coordinates.
This notation also lets us write $S^{\mu-1}$ in $\RRN$ as
\[
	S^{\mu-1} = \{x\in D^n: x_\lambda=\vec{0},\norm{x_\mu}=1\}.
\]
For $\varepsilon\in [\,0,1)$ define $T(\varepsilon)$ as a subset of $D^n$ by
\[
	T(\varepsilon) = \{x\in D^n: \norm{x_\lambda}^2>\varepsilon\}.
\]
Note that $T(\varepsilon)$ collapses onto $S^{\lambda-1}$ via the projection $(x_\lambda,x_\mu)\mapsto x_\lambda/\norm{x_\lambda}$.
We abbreviate $T(0)$ to be just $T$.

The methods in \cite{Kosi93} build the standard tools of connect sum, boundary connect sum, and joining of manifolds along submanifolds in such a way that the resulting manifold is smooth.
This is accomplished by piping the areas to be joined together through cooked up diffeomorphisms.
For the case of handle attachment, define a function $
	\alpha:T(\varepsilon)\setminus S^{\lambda-1} \to T(\varepsilon)\setminus S^{\lambda-1}
$ by
\[
	\alpha(x_\lambda, x_\mu) =
	\Bigg( 
		\frac{x_\lambda}{\norm{x_\lambda}}
		(1-\norm{x_\lambda}^2+\varepsilon)^{1/2},
		x_\mu
		\frac{
			(\norm{x_\lambda}^2-\varepsilon)^{1/2}
		}{
			(1-\norm{x_\lambda}^2)^{1/2}
		}
	\Bigg).
\]



\begin{defn}
	\label{def:handle}	
	Let $X$ be a smooth $n$--manifold with nonempty boundary and let $0\leq k\leq n$.
	An \emph{$n$--dimensional $k$-handle}, denoted here by $h$, is a copy of $D^k\times D^{n-k}$ which we attach to $\pd X$ along $\pd D^k\times D^{n-k}$ by an embedding
	\[
	  \varphi : \pd D^k \times D^{n-k} \to \pd X.
	\]
	We call $\varphi$ an \emph{attaching map}, and canonically smooth corners \cite{GompStip} in the quotient space
	\[
	  X\cup_\varphi h = \quotient{X \cup ( D^k\times D^{n-k} ) }{ \varphi(x) \sim x }
	\]
	to make $X\cup_\varphi h$ into a smooth manifold.
	The number $k$ is the \emph{index} of the handle $h$ and we call this process \emph{attaching a $k$-handle to $X$ with attachment map $\varphi$}.
	An $n$--dimensional manifold described by a handle decomposition whose handles have index no greater than $1$ is called an \emph{$n$-handlebody}.
\end{defn}

If $X\cup_\varphi h$ is a smooth manifold with attached $k$-handle, then we have special terms for the anatomy of $h$.
The $k$--disc at $D^k\times 0$ in $h$ is called the \emph{core} of $h$ and the $(n-k)$--disc $0 \times D^{n-k}$ is called the \emph{cocore}.
We call the $(k-1)$--sphere $\pd D^k \times 0$ the \emph{attaching sphere} and we call the $(n-k-1)$--sphere $ 0 \times \pd D^{n-k}$ the \emph{belt sphere}.
we call $\pd D^k\times D^{n-k}$, or its image through an attaching map $\varphi$, the \emph{attaching neighbourhood}.

\begin{rmk}
	If $\varphi$ and $\varphi'$ are isotopic attaching maps of the $k$--handle $h$ then the manifolds $X\cup_\varphi h$ and $X\cup_{\varphi'} h$ are diffeomorphic up to ambient isotopy.
	This follows from the Isotopy Extension Theorem.
	If $\varphi,$ $\varphi'$ are isotopic maps into the closed manifold $\pd X$, then the restrictions of these maps to the compact attaching neighbourhood are also isotopic hence induce an ambient isotopy $\Phi_t$.
	The diffeomorphism
	\[
		\begin{array}{cccc}
			\ident{[0,1]}\times\Phi: & [0,1]\times \pd X & \to & [0,1]\times\pd X \\
									 & (t,x) & \mapsto & (t,\Phi_t(x))
		\end{array}
	\]
	gives us the diffeomorphism $X\to X$ by identifying $[0,1]\times\pd X$ with a neighbourhood of $\pd X$ in $X$. \{CITE: RoSa\}
	
	We construct an attaching map $\varphi:\pd D^k\times D^{n-k}\to\pd X$ from an embedding of the attaching sphere $\varphi_0:\pd D^k\times 0\to \pd X$ and an identification $n$ of the normal bundle of the image of $\varphi$ with $\pd D^k \times \R^{n-k}$.
	From the Tubular Neighbourhood Theorem, this information determines an embedding of $\pd D^k\times D^{n-k}$ up to isotopy.
	Thus any attaching map is determined by
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item an embedding $\varphi_0:S^{k-1}\to\pd X$ with trivial normal bundle, and
	  \item an identification $n$ of the normal bundle $\nu\varphi_0(S^{k-1})$ with $S^{k-1}\times\R^{n-k}$ which we call a \emph{framing of} $\varphi_0(S^{k-1})$
	\end{enumerate}
	up to isotopy, and the resulting manifold $X\cup_\varphi h$ up to diffeomorphism.

\begin{rmk}
\label{rmk:onehandle}
There are two important cases of handle attachment that we care about --- attachment of handles with index $1$ and $2$.
To attach a handle of index $1$ to an $(n+1)$--manifold $W$ over its $n$--manifold boundary $M$, we specify an embedding $\varphi_0$ of $S^0=\{-1,1\}$ into $M$.
We must also define a framing of $\varphi_0(S^{0})$ in $M$.
If $M$ is oriented, then a framing of $\varphi_0(\pm 1)$ is an element of $\gl{n}{\R}$.
Because an orientation of the $n$--manifold $M$ is defined by an association of an element of $\glp{n}{\R}$ to each point of $M$, we can say that a framing of $\varphi_0(\pm 1)$ is \emph{orientation preserving} if the chosen framing element is from $\glp{n}{\R}$ and \emph{orientation reversing} if the chosen framing element is from $\gln{n}{\R}$.
With these framings defined, we can form the attaching map $\varphi$ for our 1--handle $h$.
Because the attaching map $\varphi$ is defined on the disconnected space $S^0\times D^n$, we refer to $\varphi$ as a pair of attaching maps, one for each component. 
Note here that if $W$ is path connected and both framings are orientation reversing or orientation preserving, then the manifold $W\cup_\varphi h$ is nonorientable.
If exactly one framing is orientation preserving and the other orientation reversing then $W\cup_\varphi h$ is orientable.
\end{rmk}



Because our goal is to attach 2--handles to 4--manifolds, we focus now on embeddings of $\sone$ in 3--manifolds.
We can define a framing of an embedded $\sone$ in an oriented 3--manifold from a vector field over that embedded $\sone$ and the orientation of the 3--manifold.
Attaching a 2--handle to a 4--manifold consists of defining an embedding of $\sone\times D^2$ into the boundary of the 4--manifold.
This embedding is defined entirely by the image of the attaching sphere and by a framing of that image.
A framing is an association of every point of the attaching sphere with an element of $\gl{2}{\R}$.
We care about this embedding up to isotopy, so a framing can be reduced to an element of $\pi_1(\gl{2}{\R})=\pi_1(\sone)=\Z$.
A framing makes no sense without a zero framing as reference.
Once that is defined, any $n$--framing is also defined.
There is a canonical zero--framing of a knot in $\sthr$ found by the outward unit normal vector to any Seifert surface of that knot.
