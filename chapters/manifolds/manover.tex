Our first task is to build the machinery necessary to describe manifolds.
We begin with a quick, formal definition, and build some basic properties in the first section.
In the next, we talk about a method of building and augmenting manifolds using handles.
We end by defining triangulations: a combinatorial description of a manifold that allows us to cleanly describe our algorithms.
This chapter is intended as a review of common tools in geometric topology, so in many places references will be given in lieu of proof.
