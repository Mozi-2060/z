# 3-Manifolds Algorithmically Bound 4-Manifolds

In-progress thesis for my M.Sc.

## Abstract

The question "which closed 3--manifolds bound 4--manifolds?" has been answered since the early 1950's.
The answer is "all of them."
There are many methods of proof of this fact, and the 2008 paper ``3--manifolds efficiently bound 4--manifolds'' by Dylan Thurston and Francesco Costantino gives an overview for a process that produces a bound on the number of 4--simplices needed to triangulate a 4--manifold for a given input triangulated 3-manifold.
We take the groundwork laid by Costantino and Thurston and provide algorithms to generate an explicit triangulation of a 4--manifold that bounds the given input triangulated 3--manifold.
